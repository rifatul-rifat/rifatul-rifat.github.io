                   different shops, by providing a voice recognition system for product names. I have built a voice recognition model by fine-tuning the wav2vec2
                    pre-trained model with a dataset that contais 59 unique product names and it recognizes the product names from voice with high accuracy.

                  <b>Description:</b> In this project, I have analyzed millions of customers’ data and performed customer segmentation for target marketing.
                   As this company provides the largest payment gateway and SMS gateway aggregator in Bangladesh, every day millions of data are being generated 
                   here. I have prepared some feature engineering algorithms to generate the customers' demographic features from raw data. Then I have trained 
                   the K-means Clustering algorithm for building a customer segmentation model that automatically segments all of the customers based on their 
                   demographics and purchasing behavior.

                  <b>Description:</b> In this project, we built a deep learning model that automatically detects all of the information from invoices of different 
                  formats. We built a skew corrector that provides the aligned images by removing the skewness of the images. Then, we applied the Cloud Vision API 
                  for recognizing the optical characters from images and applied a pre-trained detectron2 algorithm for detecting the tables from the image of 
                  invoices. Additionally, we built complex algorithms using the coordinates of characters for 1) parsing several fields out of the table and 
                  2) organizing the table formatted data as the original format.

                  <b>Description:</b> In this project, I have built a DNN model for predicting whether a customer of Robi
                  Axiata Limited will be churn or not within the following two months. We have used around 1.2M
                  samples data with 41 features to train this churn prediction model. Also, I have built an interactive
                  dashboard using Tableau to visualize the churn related insights obtained from the dataset.

                  Axiata Ltd. In this project, I developed a DNN model that recommend the next best data pack for
                  each of the subscribers based on their previous data usage behavior to increase company’s total
                  data revenue. I trained this model with around 1M customers’ 29 attributes.

                  <b>Description:</b> This project was for Smart Axiata, the leading telecom operator in Cambodia, to
                  analyze the Smart’s Facebook and Chatbot’s data efficiently. In this project, firstly, I built a pretrained model
                   for the Khmer language from scratch using BERT. For generating the training
                  corpus, I built a Web Scraper by which I collected around 100K Khmer articles from several
                  websites. Also, I modified google BERT official code to make compatible with Khmer language.
                  Then, using Transfer Learning, I have developed three deep learning models for the three different
                  applications such as Sentiment Analysis, Topic Classification, and NER. I deployed the model using
                  Google Cloud Function API and Docker.

                  by quality acquisition. We trained a DNN model to predict the number of quality acquisition for
                  each of the retailers over the country. We also performed the E2E automation so that the model
                  automatically set the GA target for each of the retailers each month. We also built a Tableau
                  dashboard that automatically visualizes the analysis of the model outcomes and retailers’
                  activities to the decision makers.
